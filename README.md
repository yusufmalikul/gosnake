# gosnake

Process: it took about 3 days with 4 hours each to finish the test. At first, I don't use segmentation or queue data
structure for the snake body. I just fill the array with snake body string. Then I got a difficulty to detect the snake
head. So, I decided to use golang list to store the snake body.
